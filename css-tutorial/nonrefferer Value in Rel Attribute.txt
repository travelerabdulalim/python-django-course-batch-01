The "noreferrer" value in the "rel" attribute of an HTML link (a) tag is used to indicate that the link should not pass any referrer information to the target website. In other words, when a user clicks on a link with the "rel" attribute set to "noreferrer", the target website will not receive any information about the source website. This can be useful for privacy and security reasons.
